# Term-Deposit-Prediction

This problem involves building a binary classification model to predict the probability of a client subscribing to a term deposit. Given a set of features, such as client data and last contact information, etc., and a binary output feature, it is a supervised learning problem.

The goal is to minimise the calls by eliminating those who will not subscribe to the Term Deposit. This way, a company can save huge amounts of money and redirect to where necessary.
